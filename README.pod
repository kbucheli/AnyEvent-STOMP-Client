=head1 DESCRIPTION

A STOMP client supporting STOMP version 1.2 written in Perl based on AnyEvent and Object::Event. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $client = connect $host, $port, $connect_headers

Connect to a STOMP-compatible message broker. Returns an instance of
AnyEvent::STOMP::Client.

=over

=item C<$host>

String, optional, defaults to C<localhost>. The host, where a STOMP-compatible
message broker is running.

=item C<$port>

Integer, optional, defaults to C<61613>. The TCP port we connect to. I.e. the
port where the message broker instance is listening.

=item C<$connect_headers>

Hash, optional, empty by default. May be used to add arbitrary headers to the
STOMP CONNECT frame. STOMP login headers would, for example, be supplied using
this parameter.

=back

=head3 Example
C<< my $client = AnyEvent::STOMP::Client->connect(
    '127.0.0.1',
    61614,
    {login => 'guest', passcode => 'guest'}
); >>

=head2 $client->disconnect

Sends a DISCONNECT STOMP frame to the message broker (if we are still
connected).

=head2 bool $client->is_connected

Check whether we are still connected to the broker. May only be accurate if
STOMP heart-beats are used.

=head2 $subscription_id = $client->subscribe $destination, $ack_mode, $additional_headers

Subscribe to a destination by sending a SUBSCRIBE STOMP frame to the message
broker. Returns the subscription identifier.

=over

=item C<$destination>

String, mandatory. The destination to which we want to subscribe to.

=item C<$ack_mode>

C<auto> | C<client> | C<client-individual>, optional, defaults to C<auto>.
See the STOMP documentation for further information on acknowledgement modes.

=item C<$additional_headers>

Used to pass arbitrary headers to the SUBSCRIBE STOMP frame. Broker specific
flow control parameters for example is what would want to supply here.

=back

=head2 $client->unsubscribe $destination, $additional_headers

Unsubscribe from a destination by sending an UNSUBSCRIBE STOMP frame to the
message broker.

=over

=item C<$destination>

String, mandatory. The destination from which we want to unsubscribe.

=item C<$additional_headers>

Used to pass arbitrary headers to the SUBSCRIBE STOMP frame.

=back

=head2 $client->send $destination, $headers, $body

Send a STOMP MESSAGE to the message broker.

=over

=item C<$destination>

String, mandatory. The destination to which to send the message to.

=item C<$header>

Hash, optional, empty by default. Arbitrary headers included in the MESSAGE
frame. See the STOMP documentation for supported headers.

=item C<$body>

String, optional, empty by default. The body of the message, according to the
content-type specified in the header.

=back

=head2 $client->ack $ack_id, $transaction_id

Send an ACK frame to acknowledge a received message.

=over

=item C<$ack_id>

String, mandatory. Has to match the 'ack' header of the message that is to be
acknowledged.

=item C<$transaction_id>

String, optional. A transaction identifier, if the ACK is part of a transaction.

=back

=head2 $client->nack $ack_id, $transaction_id

Send an NACK frame to NOT acknowledge a received message.

=over

=item C<$ack_id>

String, mandatory. Has to match the 'ack' header of the message that is to be
nacked.

=item C<$transaction_id>

String, optional. A transaction identifier, if the NACK is part of a
transaction.

=back

=head2 $client->begin_transaction $transaction_id, $additional_headers

Begin a STOMP transaction.

=over

=item C<$transaction_id>

String, mandatory. A unique identifier for the transaction.

=item C<$additional_headers>

Hash, optional, empty by default. Used to pass arbitrary headers to the STOMP
frame.

=back

=head2 $client->commit_transaction $transaction_id, $additional_headers

Commit a STOMP transaction.

=over

=item C<$transaction_id>

String, mandatory. A unique identifier for the transaction.

=item C<$additional_headers>

Hash, optional, empty by default. Used to pass arbitrary headers to the STOMP
frame.

=back

=head2 $client->abort_transaction $transaction_id, $additional_headers

Abort a STOMP transaction.

=over

=item C<$transaction_id>

String, mandatory. A unique identifier for the transaction.

=item C<$additional_headers>

Hash, optional, empty by default. Used to pass arbitrary headers to the STOMP
frame.

=back

=head2 Callbacks

In order for the C<AnyEvent::STOMP::Client> to be useful, callback subroutines
can be registered for the following events:

=over

=item $guard = $client->on_connected $callback

Invoked when a CONNECTED frame is received.

=item $guard = $client->on_disconnected $callback

Invoked after having successfully disconnected from a broker. I.e. when a
callback is registered for this event and the C<disconnect> subroutine is
called, then a receipt header is included in the DISCONNECT frame and the
disconnected event is fired upon receiving the receipt for the DISCONNECT frame.

=item $guard = $client->on_send_frame $callback

Invoked when the STOMP frame is sent.

=item $guard = $client->on_read_frame $callback

Invoked when a STOMP frame is received (irrespective of the STOMP command).

=item $guard = $client->on_message $callback

Invoked when a MESSAGE frame is received.

=item $guard = $client->on_receipt $callback

Invoked when a RECEIPT frame is received.

=item $guard = $client->on_error $callback

Invoked when an ERROR frame is received.

=item $guard = $client->on_subscribed $callback

Invoked after having successfully subscribed to a destination. Works behind the
scenes like the C<on_disconnected> described above.

=item $guard = $client->on_unsubscribed $callback

Invoked after having successfully unsubscribed to a destination. Works behind
the scenes like the C<on_disconnected> described above.

=back

=head3 $client->unregister_callback $guard

To unregister a previously registered callback.

=over

=item C<$guard>

The return value of one of the above on_<xyz> subroutines, identifying the registered callback.

=back
